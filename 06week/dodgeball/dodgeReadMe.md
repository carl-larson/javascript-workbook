1. People with all their properties are listed in an array.
2. A button on the UI calls the listPeopleChoices method.
3. This method creates a list item in the player element for each person that contains: a button to make the person into a person, the person's name, the person's skill.
4. The button on each person's name will remove the list item from the person list and move it to the player list.
    -This step will create a new player class with all their properties plus a couple more, such as team assignment.
5. On this new list, each item will contain: a button to move the player to the blue team, a button to move the player to the red team, the player's name, the player's age.
    - This is done by changing the team property within the player class when a team button is clicked.
6. When the team property changes, it will remove the player from the player list and add them to the appropriate team list.
